                I am writing this 25 hrs and 36 minutes away from the dealine.<br>
                Hi I'm Jevin Chen and I'm 34 years old. I was born in Belarus to a glass blower Mongolian and a can designing German.
                There is no way that I complete this in reasonable amount of time and I think I will actually pull an all nighter. As I'm typing this it is 127 am on the date that this thing is due
                I imagine you are reading this with some humor. I mean this is like cheating right? Like I'm supposed to type all this little by little one day at a time but taking care of my 3 kids is so
                hard. Their mother is out of the picture she's part of a carnival right now cheating on me with the juggler, (we're not actually divorced you know). So I'm left alone with Sheldon, Chantrelle, and little Johnny.
                Besides being raised by a single dad, our family is pretty normal, Chantrelle is cutting open her barbie dolls, Sheldon is taking a great intrest in magnifying glass, and Little Johnny has finally learned to walk!
                I'm 6'1 and 3/8 inches, I love long walks on the beach as well as league of legends and telling lies. I also am clearly delusional right now this will barely be coherent in anyways. I wonder what you
                think when you read this, like none of this is funny. It's like you are sitting here forced to read this weird as person write out the most incoherent bables that you have ever read and it's not funny the way that 
                that a clown or a comedian is funny. It's funny the way watching someone cry is funny, cause they are like at their most vulnerable but sobbing people objectivly looks hilarious though. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHA
                THERE IS ABSOLUTLY NO WAY YOU ARE READING THIS RN I AM WASTING BATTERY ON MY KEYBOARD AND TIME JUST BY TYPING THIS WEIRD STUFF. I wonder if you are reading or not but if you are make sure to drink water and
                relax
