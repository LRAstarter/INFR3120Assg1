                        <h4>
                            Hi I'm Jevin, this is my homepage where I keep some interesting things<br>
                            If this place looks rushed that's because it is. I am currently writing this paragragh with 20hrs of the deadline and I started
                            truly making this place about 5 hrs where I drank some coffee with two milks. If you want to look at the rest of my rushed, procrastinated, and bodged together
                            projects from last year, I'd suggest my projects tab that you can see at the top. While they aren't great, again bodged, I put time in them and it was also required
                            in the assignment :). I also run a blog that I don't realistically think that I will maintain I'm sure it will be filled with clever insights and not my inane and incoherent
                            bables of league, dnd and whatever I'm thinking about at the time. Lastly If you'd like to contact me you can email or I'd direct you to my contact tab where you can send me messages
                            as well as give me personal info. If any thing changes I think it would be best update y'all in my blog but this homepage should be more then just a pretty face.
                            That should be it for now<br>
